The Yuba Technology team and community take security issues in our projects seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [security@yuba.tech](mailto:security@yuba.tech) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

We'll endeavor to respond quickly, and will keep you updated throughout the process.
